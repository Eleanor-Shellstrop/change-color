## Color Change Ball

This project is a fun way for me to practice JavaScript and the DOM to change the style of a page. 

* Click the "Change Background Color" button to set a random color to the background.
* Click the "Change Ball Color" button to generate two random colors on the ball's gradient.
* Click the ball to make confetti
